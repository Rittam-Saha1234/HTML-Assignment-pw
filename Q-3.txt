Q. What is the difference between block-level and inline elements in HTML? Provide examples.
Ans. * Block-level elements: Occupy the full width of their container and start on a new line.
        Examples: <div>, <p>, <section>

    * Inline elements: Only take up as much width as necessary and stay in the same line.
        Examples: <span>, <a>, <img>
