Q. What are HTML attributes, and how do they modify elements? 
Ans. HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements, modifying their behavior or appearance. 
They are added to elements within the opening tag and are written as key-value pairs.

For example:
        <input type="text" placeholder="Enter your name">

        * type="text": Specifies the input type (text box).
        * placeholder="Enter your name": Provides placeholder text when the input is empty.
